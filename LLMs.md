# LLMs.md

Guide for AI agents (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Codex, etc.) helping a user install, use, or contribute to `brightspace-mcp-server`.

## Read the README first

Before anything else, read [README.md](https://github.com/RohanMuppa/brightspace-mcp-server/blob/main/README.md) for general context on what this project is, who it's for, and what a user can do with it. This file (LLMs.md) picks up from there with the concrete steps and codebase map you'll need to actually get things done.

## What this project is

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects an AI client to D2L Brightspace so it can read grades, assignments, announcements, syllabus, roster, discussions, and course content on demand.

Distributed on npm as `brightspace-mcp-server`. Users run it via `npx`, so they always get the latest version.

## Installing it for a user

Follow these steps in order. Stop and report back if any step fails.

### 1. Verify Node.js 20+ and native secure storage

```bash
node --version
```

If Node is missing or below v20, tell the user to install the LTS from https://nodejs.org/ and stop. Require macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or an unlocked Linux Secret Service with `secret-tool` (`libsecret-tools` on Debian/Ubuntu). Linux uses libsecret directly; secrets pass through stdin, and temporary kernel-key storage is never used. v2 has no plaintext credential fallback.

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp-server setup
```

If the user is at Purdue, use the preset:

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp-server setup --purdue
```

If the user is at a SUNY campus, use the SUNY preset. It also asks which campus
they attend, which lets sign-in skip SUNY's shared campus picker:

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp-server setup --suny
```

The wizard:

- prompts for the school's Brightspace URL (skipped with `--purdue` or `--suny`)
- asks whether MFA can run in the background or needs a visible browser, then authenticates accordingly
- saves the password in the native credential store and public settings in `~/.brightspace-mcp/config.json` (0600)
- writes the encrypted session below `~/.d2l-session/accounts/<account-hash>/` (AES-256-GCM)
- auto-configures Claude Desktop and Cursor if detected

Wait for the user to finish login and MFA before continuing.

### 3. Register the MCP server in the user's AI client

The server command to register is:

```
npx -y brightspace-mcp-server@latest
```

On **Windows**, wrap with cmd: `cmd /c npx -y brightspace-mcp-server@latest`.

Claude Desktop and Cursor are auto-configured by the setup wizard. For any other client (Windsurf, Copilot, Codex, Zed, Continue, etc.), look up the client's current MCP config format and file path, then add an entry with the command above. Config formats and paths differ per client and change over time, so verify against current client docs rather than guessing.

### 4. Restart the AI client

Tell the user to fully quit and reopen their AI client so it picks up the new MCP server.

## Re-auth

Access tokens are re-minted from the stored session cookie without a browser. When browser authentication is required, setup's MFA choice controls whether Chromium stays hidden for approval-based MFA or opens for code entry and other interaction. Missed MFA pauses automatic browser authentication, including SSO redirects, for four hours to prevent repeated phone prompts. HTTP token renewal remains allowed; the explicit command below bypasses the browser cooldown. Forward any MFA number to the user as it appears and wait for completion. Clients may hide server logs, so a terminal is the reliable place to see the number. Network errors and locked native storage should be reported without retrying MFA.

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp-server auth
```

## Available tools

Registered in `src/tools/index.ts`, schemas in `src/tools/schemas.ts`:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_my_courses` | List enrolled courses |
| `get_my_grades` | Grades for a course or all courses |
| `get_assignments` | Assignments with due dates and submission status |
| `get_upcoming_due_dates` | Due dates across all courses within a window |
| `get_announcements` | Recent course announcements |
| `get_syllabus` | Syllabus document for a course |
| `get_course_content` | Module tree and content topics |
| `get_discussions` | Discussion forums and recent posts |
| `get_roster` | Classlist for a course |
| `get_classlist_emails` | Emails of classmates and instructors |
| `download_file` | Download a file attachment (PDF, slides, etc.) to disk |
| `get_assignment_files` | Read the files attached to an assignment (spec, rubric, starter workbook) and return their text |

Quiz attempt counts are unavailable to students on the Purdue tenant: `/quizzes/{id}/attempts/` answers 403. Those quizzes carry `attemptsAvailable: false` with null counts rather than a fabricated zero.

Assignments, quizzes, and due dates each carry a `url` field that deep-links into Brightspace. `get_assignments` also returns `gradeOnly` items for gradebook columns that match no assignment or quiz, such as a proctored exam. `get_upcoming_due_dates` reads `DueDate` from assignments and `DueDate ?? EndDate` from quizzes rather than the calendar feed.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npx brightspace-mcp-server setup` | Interactive setup wizard |
| `npx brightspace-mcp-server setup --purdue` | Setup with Purdue preset |
| `npx brightspace-mcp-server setup --suny` | Setup with SUNY preset (also asks for campus) |
| `npx brightspace-mcp-server auth` | Manual reauth |
| `npx -y brightspace-mcp-server@latest` | Run the MCP server (registered in AI client config) |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to `build/` |
| `npm run dev` | Watch-mode TypeScript compile |
| `npm run test` | Run Vitest suite |
| `npm run test:run` | Run Vitest once |

## Storage locations

| Path | Contents | Permissions |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `~/.brightspace-mcp/config.json` | School URL, username, and public settings | 0600 |
| `~/.d2l-session/accounts/<account-hash>/session.json` | Encrypted access token, session cookies, and XSRF token (AES-256-GCM) | 0600 |
| `~/.d2l-session/accounts/<account-hash>/storage-state.encrypted.json` | Encrypted cookies and browser storage | 0600 |
| Native operating-system credential store | Password and random encryption key | OS access controls |

Environment values override stored configuration. An environment password is native-store input; the application does not rewrite the user's `.env` or client configuration. Account hashes bind saved state to school and username. Legacy unnamed state stays in the session root and is not replayed for a newly configured account. On upgrade, v1 secrets migrate only after verified secure writes. Retired v1 browser data may remain recoverable in Trash.

## Adding a school

Add a preset to `SCHOOL_PRESETS` in `src/setup.ts`. If the school uses a non-standard login flow (SAML, Shibboleth, custom SSO), add a handler in `src/auth/` alongside `purdue-sso.ts` and register it in `createSSOFlow()` in `src/auth/sso-flow.ts`.

## Adding a tool

1. Create `src/tools/<name>.ts` using an existing tool as a template.
2. Add the input schema to `src/tools/schemas.ts`.
3. Export it from `src/tools/index.ts`.
4. Register it in `src/index.ts`.

## Release workflow

Publishing is automated by GitHub Actions on push to `main` when `version` in `package.json` changes, after the reusable CI matrix passes on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Keep `package.json`, the lockfile, and `server.json` versions aligned. Create the GitHub release only from the verified published commit.

Always bump `version` in `package.json` in the same commit as any code or docs change. The Action skips publish if the version is unchanged, which means users will not receive the update via `npx ...@latest`.
